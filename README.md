# Graphical-Password-Authentication-Prototype





- Graphical password authentication is a method of authentication that uses visual cues, such as images or patterns, instead of traditional alphanumeric characters for a password. This type of authentication is based on the idea that it is easier for people to remember images or patterns than a string of characters.
